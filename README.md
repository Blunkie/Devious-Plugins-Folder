# Ucci external plugins

If you find any bugs and want to submit a PR, i'd be happy to review and merge it.

## Unethical Zulrah
[Directory](/unethical-zulrah/)

It has been customized by me to support banking, it does not death walk.
Config for the plugin is pretty barebones as hardcoding the banking is easier and I'm lazy. 

It does not support the use of rigour, it should be easily modifyable to do so though.

If ur running the plugin without any edits to the code make sure you have at least these items in your bank:

- Antivenom+ (4)
- Zul-andra teleport
- 2x prayer potion
- Range potion
- Magic potion
- 2x Ring of recoil
- Karambwan
